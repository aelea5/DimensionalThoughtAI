# Dimensional Thought Processing AI

## **Overview**
Dimensional Thought Processing AI is a **graph-based AI model** that navigates a structured network of thoughts using **dynamic weight adjustments** and **probability-based selection** to simulate flexible reasoning.  

Unlike traditional AI models that rely on deep learning, this system represents thoughts as **nodes in a weighted graph**, allowing for **context-aware navigation** that adjusts based on user input.

## **Features**
- **Graph-Based Thought Navigation** â€“ AI processes ideas as **interconnected concepts**.  
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustments** â€“ Thought paths change based on **context and past interactions**.  
- **Probability-Based Selection** â€“ Adds variation so responses are **less predictable**.  
- **Dual-Licensing Protection** â€“ Free for individuals, but requires a commercial license for business use.

## **Installation & Usage**
### **ðŸ”¹ Requirements**
- Python 3.8+
- NetworkX (`pip install networkx`)
- Tkinter (included with Python)
